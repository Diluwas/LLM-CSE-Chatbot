      "### Usual Structure of a Trading Session\n",
      "\n",
      "Trading sessions on the CSE are generally divided into:\n",
      "1. **Pre-Open Session**: Orders can be placed, modified, or canceled, but trades are not executed. This period is used to determine the opening price.\n",
      "2. **Open Auction Session**: The official opening price for each security is established, and the first trades of the day are executed.\n",
      "3. **Regular Trading Session (Continuous Trading)**: Bids and offers are matched and trades occur continuously until the session ends.\n",
      "4. **Market Close/Close Auction**: The session ends, with a final opportunity for trades at the closing price.\n",
